## Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components in isolation.

To access the Storybook for this project, click [here](https://openbridge-storybook.web.app).

## Demo

The demo showcases the project's functionality using Vue.js. It provides a live demonstration of the project's features and allows you to interact with the application.

To access the demo, click [here](https://openbridge-demo.web.app/).

## Installation

To use the components in your project, you can install the package from npm:

```bash
npm install @oicl/openbridge-webcomponents-vue
```

See also the [vue demo](https://github.com/Ocean-Industries-Concept-Lab/openbridge-webcomponents/tree/main/packages/vue-demo) for an example of how to use the components in a Vue.js project.

### Setup

1. Add the css file to your project:
   ```javascript
   import "@oicl/openbridge-webcomponents/src/palettes/variables.css";
   ```
2. Select the pallet by setting the `data-obc-theme` attribute on the `html` tag:
   ```html
   <html lang="en" data-obc-theme="day"></html>
   ```
3. Install the Noto Sans font by using the attached `NotoSans.tff` file. Add the following to your css:

   ```css
   @font-face {
     font-family: "Noto Sans";
     src: url("path/to/NotoSans.tff");
   }

   * {
     font-family: Noto Sans;
   }
   ```

4. Import the desired components in your project, for instance:

   ```javascript
   import ObcTopBar from "@oicl/openbridge-webcomponents-vue/components/top-bar/ObcTopBar";
   ```

5. Use the components in your project:
   ```html
   <ObcTopBar></ObcTopBar>
   ```
