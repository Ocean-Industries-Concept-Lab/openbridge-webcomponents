Welcome to the Openbridge Web Components! This readme file provides an overview of the project and its components.

# üéâ We are preparing to release OpenBridge 6.0 in March 2026 üéâ

We are currently developing the code in a joint industry project, with funding from industry partners.
The code is only available for the partners until the release in March 2026. It is possible to get access to the code in active development by joining the project.

## Storybook

[Storybook](https://openbridge-storybook.web.app) is a development environment for UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components in isolation.

## Demo

[The demo](https://openbridge-demo.web.app/) showcases the project's functionality using Vue.js. It provides a live demonstration of the project's features and allows you to interact with the application.

## CSS file for palettes

The CSS file for the palettes is located at [packages/openbridge-webcomponents/src/palettes/variables.css](packages/openbridge-webcomponents/src/palettes/variables.css).
The file is called `variables.css` and contains all the openbridge pallets (bright, day, dusk, night).
It can be used to set the color theme of components.
To select the pallet, set the `data-obc-theme` attribute on the `html` tag:

```html
<html lang="en" data-obc-theme="day"></html>
```

## Components

The components for this project are implemented in the `package/openbridge-webcomponents` folder.

## Installation

To use the components in your project, you can install the package from npm:

```bash
npm install @oicl/openbridge-webcomponents
```

To use the components in your Vue.js project, you can install the package from npm:

```bash
npm install @oicl/openbridge-webcomponents-vue
```

### Setup

1. Add the css file to your project:
   ```javascript
   import "@oicl/openbridge-webcomponents/src/palettes/variables.css";
   ```
2. Select the pallet by setting the `data-obc-theme` attribute on the `html` tag:
   ```html
   <html lang="en" data-obc-theme="day"></html>
   ```
3. Select the global component size by setting the class (it could be `regular`, `medium`, `large` or `xl`):
   ```html
   <body class="obc-component-size-regular"></body>
   ```
   When the upgrade to OpenBridge 6.0 the size of each component can be modified individually by setting the class on each component. It can also be used to set the size of all components in a container.
4. Install the Noto Sans font by using the attached `NotoSans.tff` file. Add the following to your css:

   ```css
   @font-face {
     font-family: "Noto Sans";
     src: url("path/to/NotoSans.tff");
   }

   * {
     font-family: Noto Sans;
   }
   ```

5. Import the desired components in your project, for instance:

   ```javascript
   import "@oicl/openbridge-webcomponents/dist/components/top-bar/top-bar.js";
   ```

   or with vue wrapper:

   ```javascript
   import ObcTopBar from "@oicl/openbridge-webcomponents-vue/components/top-bar/ObcTopBar.vue";
   ```

6. Use the components in your project:
   ```html
   <obc-top-bar></obc-top-bar>
   ```
   or with vue wrapper:
   ```html
   <ObcTopBar></ObcTopBar>
   ```

## Getting Started Developing

> **‚ùóWarning‚ùó** As the code is currently developed in a closed repo we will not accept any PR before the code is published.

### With VS Code Dev Container (recommended)

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install visual studio code
3. Install Docker (requires license for large organizations)
4. Open visual studio code
5. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
6. Run the command `Dev Container: Open Workspace in Container`
   Select the `openbridge-webcomponents.code-workspace` file in the root folder of the repository.
   This will open the project in a containerized environment with all the necessary dependencies installed.
7. Optional: Go to the `package/openbridge-webcomponents` folder and run `yarn storbook` to start the Storybook development environment.
8. Optional: Go to the `package/vue-demo` folder and run `yarn dev` to run the Vue.js demo application.

### Without VS Code devcontainer, not recommended

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Node.js (version 20) and Yarn.
3. Run `yarn install` in the root folder to install the dependencies.
4. Run `yarn run build:lib` to build all libraries.
5. Optional: Go to the `package/openbridge-webcomponents` folder and run `yarn storbook` to start the Storybook development environment.
6. Optional: Go to the `package/vue-demo` folder and run `yarn dev` to run the Vue.js demo application.

## Packages:

This mono-repo contains the following packages:

- `openbridge-webcomponents`: The main package containing the web components.
- `openbridge-webcomponents-vue`: A wrapper for the web components to be used in Vue.js projects. It is autogenerated from the `openbridge-webcomponents` package.
- `vue-demo`: A demo application showcasing the web components in a Vue.js project.

## Steps in the development process:

### Formatting:

Run `yarn format:all` to format the code using Prettier.

### Testing:

We use snapshot testing of the components through storybook.
To run the test:

1. Ensure that storybook is running. If it is not running, go to the `package/openbridge-webcomponents` folder and run `yarn storybook` to start storybook.
2. Run `yarn test-storybook` in the `package/openbridge-webcomponents` folder to run the tests.

Use the `yarn test-storybook --watch` command to watch for changes and re-run the tests.
Use the `yarn test-storybook -u` command to update the snapshots.
